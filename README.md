Blood vessel processing code for quantifying sample brain slices

Code is stored in the form of Jupyter Notebooks whose contents can be run and modified for any set of images.

Each notebook contains a workspace to run and visualize the contents and outputs of sets of data; code between the notebooks themselves are nearly identical. 

For the paper: Specific targeting of brain endothelial cells using enhancer AAV vectors
